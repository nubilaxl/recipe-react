Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice potatoes into 1\/2-inch pieces. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1\/2-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; finely chop whites. Peel and finely chop garlic.\r\n\r\n2. In a medium bowl, soak bread with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings); break up with your hands until pasty. Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3\/4 tsp kosher salt; 11\/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes (we'll glaze the meatloaves then).\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until very\r\ntender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1\/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic powder, 1\/4 cup ketchup (1\/2 cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4).\r\n\r\n4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from oven. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save\r\nthe rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through, and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more.\r\n\r\n5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pot used for potatoes over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook\r\nuntil fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1\/4 tsp wasabi. Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!)\r\n\r\n6. Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots between plates. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for dipping.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/o2wb6p1581005243.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"","strIngredient1":"Potatoes","strIngredient2":"Carrots","strIngredient3":"Scallions","strIngredient4":"Garlic","strIngredient5":"Bread","strIngredient6":"Garlic Powder","strIngredient7":"Soy Sauce","strIngredient8":"Ground Beef","strIngredient9":"Vegetable Oil","strIngredient10":"Sugar","strIngredient11":"Butter","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"5","strMeasure2":"12 ounces","strMeasure3":"1","strMeasure4":"2 cloves","strMeasure5":"1 Slice","strMeasure6":"1","strMeasure7":"2","strMeasure8":"1","strMeasure9":"1 tsp ","strMeasure10":"2 tsp","strMeasure11":"2 tbsp","strMeasure12":" ","strMeasure13":" ","strMeasure14":" ","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},
{"id":1,"favorite":false,"idMeal":"52942","strMeal":"Roast fennel and aubergine paella","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Vegan","strArea":"Spanish","strInstructions":"1 Put the fennel, aubergine, pepper and courgette in a roasting tray. Add a glug of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss around to coat the veggies in the oil. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, turning a couple of times until the veg are pretty much cooked through and turning golden.\r\n\r\n2 Meanwhile, heat a paella pan or large frying pan over a low\u2013 medium heat and add a glug of olive oil. Saut\u00e9 the onion for 8\u201310 minutes until softened. Increase the heat to medium and stir in the rice, paprika and saffron. Cook for around 1 minute to start toasting the rice, then add the white wine. Reduce by about half before stirring in two-thirds of the stock. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes without a lid, stirring a couple of times.\r\n\r\n3 Stir in the peas, add some seasoning, then gently mix in the roasted veg. Pour over the remaining stock, arrange the lemon wedges on top and cover with a lid or some aluminium foil. Cook for a further 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4 To ensure you get the classic layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, increase the heat to high until you hear a slight crackle. Remove from the heat and sit for 5 minutes before sprinkling over the parsley and serving.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/1520081754.jpg","strTags":"Vegan,Paella","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H5SmjR-fxUs","strIngredient1":"Baby Aubergine","strIngredient2":"Fennel","strIngredient3":"Red Pepper","strIngredient4":"Courgettes","strIngredient5":"Onion","strIngredient6":"Paella Rice","strIngredient7":"Paprika","strIngredient8":"Saffron","strIngredient9":"White Wine","strIngredient10":"Vegetable Stock","strIngredient11":"Frozen Peas","strIngredient12":"Lemon","strIngredient13":"Parsley","strIngredient14":"Salt","strIngredient15":"Black Pepper","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"6 small","strMeasure2":"4 small","strMeasure3":"1 thinly sliced","strMeasure4":"1 medium","strMeasure5":"1 finely chopped ","strMeasure6":"300g","strMeasure7":"1 tsp ","strMeasure8":"pinch","strMeasure9":"200ml","strMeasure10":"700ml","strMeasure11":"100g ","strMeasure12":"1 chopped","strMeasure13":"Handful","strMeasure14":"pinch","strMeasure15":"pinch","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https:\/\/www.homestylemag.co.uk\/recipe\/517\/main-courses\/roast-fennel-and-aubergine-paella","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},
{"id":2,"favorite":false,"idMeal":"52993","strMeal":"Honey Balsamic Chicken with Crispy Broccoli & Potatoes","strMealAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Chicken","strArea":"American","strInstructions":"2 Servings\r\n\r\n1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Cut potatoes into 1\/2-inch-thick wedges. Toss on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread potatoes out across entire sheet.) Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (we'll add the broccoli then). \r\n\r\n2. Meanwhile, cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Peel and finely chop garlic. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine 1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and half the garlic. Microwave until garlic sizzles, 30 seconds. \r\n\r\n3. Once potatoes have roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven and add broccoli to empty side; carefully toss with garlic oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, add broccoli to a second sheet.) Continue roasting until potatoes and broccoli are browned and crispy, 15-20 minutes more. \r\n\r\n4. While veggies roast, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per side. (If chicken browns too quickly, reduce heat to medium.) Turn off heat; set chicken aside to rest. Wash out pan. \r\n\r\n5. Heat pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil and remaining garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in vinegar, honey, stock concentrate, and 1\/4 cup water (1\/3 cup for 4 servings). Simmer until thick and glossy, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper. \r\n\r\n6. Return chicken to pan and turn to coat in glaze. Divide chicken, broccoli, and potatoes between plates. Spoon any remaining glaze over chicken and serve.
